### 2. Docker Image  
Docker image is created by `Docker file` (basically a script we can write instructions here with DSL: Docker Syntax or YAML/.yaml)

We can modify container but we cannot modify the base or original image.

### 3. Docker Registry   
Docker Registry/Hub is centralised platform to share base & custom docker images within each others  
##### user can name tag with alphanumerics for custom docker images:

##### we can make our repository public or private just like GIT:

##### Docker Containe = Application + Dependancies :

##### Lightweight:

##### Complete Isolation:

##### Shares unused Memory to other co-existing containers:
